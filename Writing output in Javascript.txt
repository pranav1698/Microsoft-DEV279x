Methods:
    1.window.alert(): Displays Information via a popup on the webpage.
    Note: You can generally call the alert method without specifying the window object.

    Note: The data you provide to the document.write() method can be regular text or HTML.
          This data will be added to the body section of the HTML document and interpreted as HTML.

    3.innerHTML: Most common way of outputting information using javascript to modify the contents the element on page.
        To do This using JS, we first identify the HTMl element on the page that has the ID you request.
        For e.g; document.getElementById(title) method.
        Once we have acess to the element you can modify its contents using the innnerHTMl property and provide the content to 
        replace the existing content.
        Note: You can also include HTML code in the inner HTML of an element. 
            (Since the contents of an element can include HTML).

    4.consle.log(): Another way of outputting information using javascript does'nt involve modifying the webpage.
        Using the console.log() method, you can output information to the JavaScript browser console.

        Writing the line: console.log("Testing..."); would print the text "Testing..." to the console window when the program runs. 
        The developer can access the console in the browser when the script is running to see this output.
